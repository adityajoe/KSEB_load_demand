# KSEB_load_demand

•	In this project I used historical demand data collected from Kerala State Electricity Board and weather data collected from IMD and ANERT. My goal was to create a Machine Learning Model which could predict the load demand for the next day/hour given the required data.

•	After collating the data from various sources, I performed simple feature engineering and exploratory data analysis. I found the demand to follow different patterns on weekdays and weekends as well as on holidays.Demand also varied according to the time of the day. I also added new features like Hourly average of previous weeks.These features made our model more sensible to less prone to outliers. I also performed standardization.

•	After the initial data preprocessing, I used Linear regression to create the model. My model gave an accuracy of 97 -98%
